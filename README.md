BLACKJACK - The Game

(Whoever gets the highest score without going past the score of 21)

How I want the game to be structured: <--- add to this if you more comes to mind

- random 2 cards revealed for player 1
- random 2 cards revealed for player 2 or computer
- the rest of the deck faced down (dealer cards)
- have the deck choose random cards to give players
- ace card = 11
- a button to "hit" or "stay" when prompted for each player
- a score of some sort next to or around the player's cards
- want the cards and buttons to be centered on the screen
- Announce the winner on the screen
- a restart button to go again with new set of cards

Code to implement:

- a shuffling function (DONE)
- a function for the whole deck of cards (DONE)
- players (DONE)
- a function for the buttons and actions to match (DONE)
- card images in HTML (DONE - in cards folder)
- figure out a way to center everything (DONE)

What I want to figure out:

- how to add text to the side of the images (not needed)
- how to move the dealer stack wherever i want (not needed - decks centered)
- a start game function (DONE)
- whether or not you want the game to be between player 1 and player two or player 1 vs computer (decided to do player vs computer)
- how to make the restart button refresh the page and give new cards (DONE)
